RH:
I changed already ROI data storage to use ICLpoint and ICLsize structs.
In order to become thread-safe, filter operations should not actually change
the source images ROI, but assume its own, eventually modified version.
For this purpose roiData (iChannel, ICLpoint* poOffset=0) provides an additional
default argument (poOffset) now. This is already changed for IPP version
of ICLMedian and ICLConvolution.

What should be done for the fallback solution, i.e. ICLIterator???
I would suspect, this needs change as well.
