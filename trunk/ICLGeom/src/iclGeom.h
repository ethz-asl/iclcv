/** \mainpage ICLGeom Package for Handling 3D Geometry

    The ICLGeom package provides functions and classes for handling 3D-geometry related problems. 
    This includes for example 3D camera calibration and 3D position estimation from multiple camera views. 
    ICLGeom's fundamental component is the icl::Camera class. Another important part of the ICLGeom package
    is the lightweight scene API which essentially consists of the icl::Scene2 and the icl::Object2 classes. 
    The icl::Scene2 class is linked to the icl::Camera class which helps to visualize simple 3D scenes and
    to navigate in this scenes.
