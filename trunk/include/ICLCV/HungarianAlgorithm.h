        \section Linear Assignment Problems (LAP)
        A LAP is defined as follows:
        You have \f$N\f$ workers \f$w_i\f$ and  \f$N\f$ tasks \f$t_j\f$. Assigning a certain worker 
        \f$w_i\f$ to a certain task \f$t_j\f$ produces costs \f$d_{ij}\f$ which are defined by a 
        square cost matrix \f$D=\{d_{ij}\}\f$. Each worker can only be assigned to perform 
        a single task, and each task has to be processed. The problem is to find the
        optimal assignment to minimize the arising costs.
