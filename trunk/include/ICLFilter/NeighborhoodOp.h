  /// unary operators that work on each pixels neighborhood \ingroup UNARY \ingroup NBH
  /** TODO:: check!!
      The NeighborhoodOp class builds a base class for unary operations employing
      a filter mask which is moved over the ROI of the source image(s), 
      e.g. convolution filters use some convolution masks.
      To this end the class provides members to store the size and anchor
      of the filter mask.

      Special care has to be taken, when applying a filter mask to the border
      of an image, e.g. in case of full-image ROI. In this case the filter
      might access undefined pixel values outside the image, actually causing
      a segfault in most cases.

      Hence, the used ROI size of the source image is <em> shrinked </em> if
      neccessary, such that the filter mask always fits into the image, when
      moved over the ROI. For this purpose the method adaptROI is provided,
      which computes the to-be-used ROI. The ROI of the source image is not
      actually changed, which makes the filter operation thread safe, because
      simultaneous operations running on the source image within different
      threads do not interfere.
