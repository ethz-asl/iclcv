  /** @section OV Overview

      The canny edge detector detects image borders from gray-scale images. It's result
      is an Img8u binary image containing thin borders.

      @section AL Algorithm
      The canny edge detector is a very common filter for edge detection, therefore it is
      already implemented in the IPP. Currently no non-IPP implementation is available.
      The algorithm can be split into 3 major parts:
      -# <b>Image differentiation</b> here, image x and y gradients are computed. Commonly this
         is done using sobel- X and -Y filters.
      -# <b> Non-Maximum suppression</b> The image differentiation result is converted into an
         image intensity map and into a gradient direction map. Now all pixels are suppressed, 
         that are not <em>ridges</em> in gradient intensity map <em>mountain</em>.
      -# <b>Thresholding</b> Here a special threshold operation is used. Two threshold values 
         (l=low threshold and h=high threshold) split the edge intensity scale into 3 parts:
         -# <em>below the lower threshold</em> pixels with such values are in any case no border 
            pixels
         -# <em>above the upper threshold</em> these pixels are border pixels
         -# <em>in the middle section</em> these pixels are only border pixels if there's a 
            connected chain of other pixels (each also in the middle section) that is connected
            in any way to a border pixel.
      
      (please see IPP's canny edge detector documentation for more detail)
      
      @section PB pre-blur features
      In some cases (e.g. if input images are created synthetically) the border intensity image
      has too hard edges (e.g. from edges from black to white). In this case, the IPP canny edge 
      detector implementation overlooks these borders independent on the given threshold values.
