  /// Operator that remaps an image with given look-up map
  /** \section OV Overview
      A 'Warping' operation on images is any operation, that works
      on the local domain of the image i.e. it moves the images
      pixel locations. Special warping routines like affine operations
      (see AffineOp) can be performed using a functional rule that 
      is applied on each destination pixel to determine it's corresponding
      source pixels (using the AffineOp example again, this function
      might be e.g. an affine matrix multiplication).
      If the mapping function gets more complex (e.g. in case of camera
      lens distortion), computation might become too slow, however
      computational performance even for most complex mappings can be 
      limited by pre-calculating a 
      so-called warp-table (a 2-channel 2D-look-up-table, that contains
      the result of the mapping for each pixel). Once having obtained 
      such a LUT, a WarpOp will help to apply the table lookup operation
      conveniently and safely.
      
      \section ROI ROI-Support
      Currently this Op does not provide ROI handling (although used
      IPP-functions do)
      
      \section IPP IPP-Support
      Support is purely optional and only defined in case of depth8u
      or depth32f input images
      
      \section PERF Performance
      As already mentioned, the operation performance does not depend
      on the mapping function at all. Hence there're only few parameters,
      that influence the apply time of a WarpOp instance:
      - image depth (we expect icl8u's to be a bit faster then the other types)
      - image size (warping is linear wrt the number of image pixels)
      - interpolation method

      Here's a short list of benchmarks. For benchmarking your system, 
      you can use the icl-warp-op-test application.

       interpolation:   NN             LINEAR
      --------------------------------------------
      - depth8u:       8ms(IPP)       13ms(IPP)
      - depth16s:      42ms           79ms
      - depth32s:      46ms           79ms
      - depth32f:      13ms(IPP)      20ms(IPP)
      - depth64f:      54ms           92ms
