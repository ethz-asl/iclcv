  /// Utility class for displaying images using OpenGLs texture mapping abilities \ingroup UNCOMMON
  /** As former pixel drawing implementations used glDrawPixels(..) to draw images 
      into a GL context, the visualization engine became very slow on some machines.
      Many sources mentioned already, that there are some performance problems with
      the glDrawPixels(..) procedure.\n

      The new implementation uses OpenGL's texture mapping abilities for drawing images.\n
      It allows you to draw an Img<T> into a specific rect on the screen by using 
      hardware accelerated drawing function of OpenGL.
      
      This class provides a more convenient access to this functionalities by wrapping
      all texture mapping functions. A GLTextureMapImage can be created by given size,
      channel count and a so called <em>cellSize</em> which is explained in the 
      following. It will break a given image apart into several rectangular pieces, that
      are transferred (in interleaved data order) into the video memory of the graphics 
      device to be able to draw these parts as simple textures. The given cellSize 
      defines how large theses cells are an therewith, how many cells are needed. \n

      In addition, it knows two modes
      - single buffer mode
      - multi buffer mode
      
      which have different initialization and drawing procedures for different use cases.
      The <em>single buffer mode</em> is used, when the image should just be drawn now. This mode
      has to be used, when the GLTextureMapImage instance is created just inside of OpenGL's
      drawing function (not outside or in another Thread!). In this case, the image drawing
      procedure is optimized to use as less dynamic memory as possible. If the image 
      is created outside of OpenGL's drawing function, the singleBuffer flag has to be
      set to false. In this case, no GL commands are used except in the drawTo(..) function.
      
      Disregarding the mode, there are 3 steps that must be performed to draw
      an image into the screen. 
      -# creation
        - <b>single buffer mode</b>: in this case, some OpenGL commands are already   
          used in the constructor. A data for a single image cell (size = channel count *
          cellSize * cellSize) is allocated and glTexture handles are reserved.
        - <b>multi buffer mode</b>: here, no OpenGL commands must be called, but 
          instead of this, data buffers are created for all image cells.

      -# updating the textures (by given image)
        - <b>single buffer mode</b>: This step will transfer the image data into the
          video memory. As in OpenGL all data of one texture must be transferred by a 
          single TexImage2D call, the data is temporarily transformed into interleaved data
          order by calling ICLCC's planarToInterleaved method. Here, the cell data buffer,
          which was created in the constructor is exploited, to avoid redundant data 
          allocation during run-time. 
        - <b>multi buffer mode</b>: In this case, however no GL commands may be used. So the
          data is not transferred into the video memory, be it is pre-buffered in interleaved
          order into the array of cell data buffers, that have been reserved in the 
          constructor.
      -# drawing step
        - <b>single buffer mode</b>: In this mode, all image data is available in the
          video devices memory, so it can be drawn directly cell by cell. The drawing
          function supports implicit scaling and transforming of GL's matrices to draw
          the image into a given rectangle in the window.
        - <b>multi buffer mode</b>: In this case, the interleaved image data, available
          in the cell data buffer matrix must be transferred into the video memory, before
          it can be drawn exactly as if single buffer mode was enabled here.

      
      \section DET detail
      Internally some additional computations must be performed as the matrix of texture 
      cells will be an amount of pixels wider and higher then the image to draw. 
     
      \section TMP allowed template parameters
      Because OpenGL does not support double valued textures, the GLTextureMapImage class
      is not instantiated for depth64f. To visualize double images, it is recommended to
      transform them into a float representation first.
