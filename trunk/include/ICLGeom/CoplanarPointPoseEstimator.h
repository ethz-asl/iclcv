  /// Utility class that allows for 6D pose estimation from a set of at least 4 coplanar points
  /** \section GEN General
      In contrast to the POSIT algorithms (see icl::Posit), this class is able to compute
      the 6D-pose of an object from coplanar points.
      
      \section POSE Pose Detection Problem
      Given at least 4 model-points (which are 2D because of the fact, that they
      have to be coplanar), where no subset of 3 points is collinear, and a set of corresponding
      pixel-locations of these points, the pose-estimation problem can be redefined as
      homography problem.

      \section OBJCS The Object Coordinate Frame
      As all reference points of the object are coplanar, you can define the objects
      coordinate in that way that all reference points lie within the z=0 plane. 
      As the algorithm uses this as prior knowledge, the CoplanarPointPoseEstimator::getPose
      interface does allow to pass 2D object reference points only.
      
      \section ALG Algorithm
      We implemented the algorithm from the paper 
      "Pose estimation based on four coplanar point correspondences" written by Yang et. al. 
      and published 2009. Internally, a 9 by 2N matrix A is created. The solution for the
      pose detection problem is basically achieved by minimizing |Ax| using SVD. 
      Finally, the resulting x can be used to obtain the transformation matrix. We also added
      one heuristic to the method described in the paper above. As the projection of a plane 
      is ambiguous (you can project from the front and from the back), we always use always 
      use the solution, where the resulting z-value is in front of the camera (Otherwise, we
      would not be able to see it). Mathematically, this means, that we do not always use
      x, but sometimes also -x, which obviously leads to the same error |Ax|.
      
      \section REF Reference Frames
      CoplanarPointPoseEstimator instances can be set up to return the estimated pose
      w.r.t. the world frame or with respect to the camera frame. If you obtain the pose
      w.r.t. the camera frame, you have to multiply it with the inverted camera coordinate
      system transformation matrix.
      
      \section SCENE Integration with ICL's Scene class
      In order to use the CoplanarPointPoseEstimator to estimate an objects pose matrix
      for visualization using an instance of the icl::Scene class, you can simply define an
      objects base vertices in the object coordinate frame:\n
      e.g. (1,1,1,1), (1, 1,-1,1), ... for a unity cube.
      For moving these points to their real location in the 3D scene, you simply have to 
      transform these vectors by the obtained 'w.r.t. world frame' transformation matrix.
      
      \section BENCH Benchmark Results
      Simple Pose estimation with 4 points needs about 80 ns on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5530
      (2.40GHz). If 9 points are used, it needs about 110 ns.
