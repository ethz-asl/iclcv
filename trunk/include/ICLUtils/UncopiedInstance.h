    /// Utility class for class instances that are created brand new on copy
    /** Consider the following problem:
        You have a class with some mutex'ed interface
        \code
        class Camera{
           float *data;
           Mutex mutex;
           public:
           void lock(){ mutex.lock(); }
           void unlock() { mutex.unlock(); }
           ...
        };
        \endcode
        As the mutex class is an instance of the Uncopyable interfaces, it cannot 
        be copied. Furthermore, all classes X that have a member of type Mutex are Uncopyable too, unless,
        A special copy constructor and assignment operator for X is defined. This can be bypassed using the
        UncopiedInstance interface.\n
        Due to template based inheritance, Uncopied instances can be used as their (templated) child instances.
        One major drawback is, that the wrapped T instance (wrapped by inheritance) is always constructed using
        the ()-empty constructor.\n
        The Camera class from above can simply use the default copy constructor and assignment operator if we
        use an UncopiedInstance<Mutex> instead of the Mutex class itself.
        \code
        class Camera{
           float *data;
           UncopiedInstance<Mutex> mutex;
           public:
           void lock(){ mutex.lock(); }
           void unlock() { mutex.unlock(); }
           ...
        };
        
    */
    template<class T>
    class UncopiedInstance : public T{
      public:
      
      /// default constructor calls T()
      inline UncopiedInstance():T(){}
      
      /// default copy constructor calls T()
      inline UncopiedInstance(const UncopiedInstance &other):T(){}
      
      /// assignment operator (does NOT call T::operator=(other))
      inline UncopiedInstance &operator=(const UncopiedInstance &other){
        return *this;
      }
    };
