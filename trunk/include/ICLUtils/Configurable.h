      that shall be changed at runtime. The Configurable-subclasses can define properties that can
      be accessed by string identifiers. Each property has one of ... TODO

      \section IMPL Implementing the Configurable Interface
      There are two ways to implement the Configurable interface. You can either reimplement the
      Configurables virtual configuration functions
      \code
      /// sets value of a property (always call call_callbacks(propertyName) or Configurable::setPropertyValue)
      virtual void setPropertyValue(const std::string &propertyName, const Any &value) throw (ICLException);
      
      /// returns Configurable property list
      virtual std::vector<std::string> getPropertyList();
      
      /// returns type of given property 
      virtual std::string getPropertyType(const std::string &propertyName);
      
      /// returns info for given property
      virtual std::string getPropertyInfo(const std::string &propertyName);
      
      /// returns value for given property
      virtual Any getPropertyValue(const std::string &propertyName);
      
      /// returns volatileness for given property
      virtual int getPropertyVolatileness(const std::string &propertyName);
      \endcode
      or you can use the Configurales internal string based property storage by adding
      properties with
      \code
      void addProperty(const std::string &name, const std::string &type, 
      const std::string &info, const std::string &value="", 
      int volatileness=0) throw (ICLException); 
      \endcode
      Reimplementing the virtual functions has several performance advantagest, but it usually entails more
      implementation expense. Using the Configurables internal property storage, can help to reduce the number of
      state-member variables in the derived classes. But in this case, all property-values are stored in a
      map as strings. Therefore, a map-lookup has to be performed and a string has to be parsed before a certain
      property value is available. But please note that in most cases this will be not critical at all.
      
      
      \section CP Child Configurables
      Configurables can not only have a list of properties that can be got and set, but also a list
      of chlidren. All child-properties will also become properties of it's parent. However, the 
      first section prefix (which is used for the property-tab's label) can be adapted. <b>Note</b> that
      this behaviour must be preserved if the virtual functions setPropertyValue and getPropertyValue are
      reimplemented. Usually, you can simply call Configurable::[set/get]PropertyValue(...) at the
      end of you versions of these methods.
