  /** \section GEN General information
      The Region class provides several region information:
      - size (pixel count of the region
      - value (pixel value of the region; Currently each region is
        defined by connected Pixels with identical intensity values)
      - boundary (list of outer boundary pixels of the region)
      - formfactor (normed ratio between image pixel size and boundary
        length)
      - cog (center of gravity of the region)
      - bounding box (outer bounding box of the region)
      - scanlines (low level access to underlying list of scanlines)
      - pixels (list of all region pixels)
      - local pca information (angles and length of major axis')

      \section INT Internal Information
      Regions are created by a RegionDetector object, which passes a
      RegionPart-Multi-Tree structure to the Regions constructor.
      in addition, the underlying image, the regions value and the
      RegionDetector maxSize parameter is given. If given RegionPart-Multi-
      Tree is traversed from top to the bottom, the current pixel size is 
      computed simultaneously. By this means the recursive collection
      procedure can be stopped immediately if pixel count is larger than
      the maximum region size. \n
      Region size as well as region center of gravity is calculated during
      the tree descent in constructor. All other information are calculated
      only on demand, i.e. if the corresponding getter function is called.
      
      \section INT2 Internal Processing
      Most high level features, such as bounding boxes or PCA information, 
      can be calculated efficiently on the underlying scanline structure.
      Outer binary pixels are calculated on the underlying image.
      
      \section CP Copying
      To avoid deep copies of internal region data, Region class implements ICL's
      ShallowCopyable interface which provides a shallow copied implementation
      class, by using a reference counting smart pointer.
