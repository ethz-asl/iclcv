Interactive GUI Applications
============================

interesting image regions, or adjusting a threshold using a
slider. ICL's **GUI** creation framework provides a very intuitive and
easy-to-use interface to create even complex interactive applications.

Let's start with a very simple interactive application. Consider a
simple online image thresholding application, where a slider is to be
used to define the current threshold value at run-time.
