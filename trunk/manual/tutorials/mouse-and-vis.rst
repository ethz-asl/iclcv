Visualization and Mouse Interaction
===================================

In this part we will learn how synchronize GUI interaction,
visualization and image processing. Let's risk a more complex task:

We implement an application that allows for picking a reference color
using mouse input. The reference color is then used to create a
binarized color distance map, that is used as input for blob
detection. Finally, result regions are highlighted graphically.
